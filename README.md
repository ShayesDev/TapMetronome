# TapMetronome
A simple tap metronome application for WearOS devices.

Built for Android watches running WearOS. Allows the user to tap a tempo on the face of the WearOS device. The measure of the tempo is displayed on-screen in BPM (beats per minute) and the watch vibrates to the tempo.

Written for my own personal use, as I couldn't find an application that did exactly what I wanted. The APK attached is simply the build from the minimal testing that I did and it may not work as expected, as I have only tested it on my own watch (Fossil Gen 5).
